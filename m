Yes, given that there's only one device below a root port it will either 
be a switch or a multi-function device. In the multi-function device 
case, I'm pretty sure the spec disallows routing-to-self so doing a P2P 
transaction in that sense isn't going to work unless the device 
specifically supports it and intercepts the traffic before it gets to 
the port.

But, if we're talking about multi-function devices it should be able to 
do everything within it's own driver so it's not exactly Peer-to-Peer. 
Still, if someone has such hardware I think it's up to them to add 
support for this odd situation.
