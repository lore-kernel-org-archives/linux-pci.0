But what happens with that PCI memory ? Is it effectively turned into
nromal memory (ie, usable for normal allocations, potentially used to
populate user pages etc...) or is it kept aside ?

Also on ppc64, the physical addresses of PCIe make it so far appart
that there's no way we can map them into the linear mapping at the
normal offset of PAGE_OFFSET + (pfn << PAGE_SHIFT), so things like
page_address or virt_to_page cannot work as-is on PCIe addresses.
