I don't think reducing the number of arguments is a good argument for
squashing some of them together.

I don't really want to add a structure like that because it adds management
complexity for all the callers because it contains per-bridge things (bus,
parent, domain, resource, sysdata).  Things like struct pci_ops and struct
pci_host_bridge_ops are much simpler because drivers can statically
allocate a single copy and use it for multiple devices.

I think it might make sense to put the struct pci_ops pointer inside struct
pci_host_bridge_ops.  That would get rid of one of the arguments.

You might also be able to get rid of the "bus" argument, since the caller
should be passing an IORESOURCE_BUS resource in the resource list, and
"bus" should be the same as res->start.
