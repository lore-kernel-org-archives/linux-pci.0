I think this is true only for BEI = 6 which is for type-1 config space 
only (i.e. for bridges)

I am thinking about splitting out the bridge part of the patch set, as 
my systems work fine without explicitly assigning bridge resources via 
EA.  That would allow us to more forward with the patches that are less 
controversial, and spend more time hashing out the proper approach to 
take with bridges.

I don't really understand what you are saying here.  My reading of the 
spec. is that BEI[0..5] are PF BARs and each may have any of the 
properties that are allowed for normal BARs (io, memory-nonprefetchable, 
memory-prefetchable).  BEI[9..14] are VF BARs, and likewise may have any 
of the properties that are alloed for normal VF bars 
(memory-nonprefetchable, memory-prefetchable)

I guess in theory EA allows you to allocate 6 64-bit BARs, where you 
would be limited to only 3 64-bit normal BARs
