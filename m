... except that having all that SEV-specific code in main code paths is
yucky and I'd like to avoid it, if possible.

So how hard would it be if the hypervisor allocated that memory for the
guest instead? It would allocate it decrypted and guest would need to
access it decrypted too. All in preparation for SEV-ES which will need a
block of unencrypted memory for the guest anyway...

See above: so purely theoretically speaking, the hypervisor could prep
that decrypted range for the guest. I'd look in Paolo's direction,
though, for the feasibility of something like that.

Thanks.
