[Resolved the problems written at the last post.]

Bisecting ended here:

https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=34b48db66e08ca1c1bc07cf305d672ac940268dc

block: remove artifical max_hw_sectors cap


Removing this patch on 3.19 and 4.1 make things working again. Didn't
test 4.0, but I think it's the same. No more AMD-Vi IO_PAGE_FAULTS  with
that patch reverted.


Please check why this patch triggers AMD-Vi IO_PAGE_FAULTS.
