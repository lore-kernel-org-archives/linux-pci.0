I think that is what the conversion to pci_scan_bus_parented() is about:
The idea is that we add the correct bus resource to callers of
pci_scan_bus_parented or pci_scan_bus and then change them to call
pci_scan_root_bus instead.

But those don't have to use the new pci_create_host_bridge() function,
right?

It also depends on having a valid device pointer. The idea is that the memory
is automatically freed if the probe() function returns with an error, or
the device driver gets unloaded. For the classic PCI hosts that are not
connected to a device, that wouldn't work of course.
