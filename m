I agree that it would be nice for applications to get these definitions
from a single place, but I'm not sure that include/uapi/linux/pci_ids.h
needs to be that place.

These constants are just copies of what's in the spec, and I don't think
you're suggesting that the constants are necessary to use a kernel API.

I know the kernel does provide access to values via sysfs "class" files,
but the kernel is just passing the values through from the hardware.
That's analogous to reading the class with setpci, and I don't think it
leads to a requirement that the kernel export all the information about how
to interpret the class values.

I haven't looked at libpci or libudev, but it sounds like you think those
are not good solutions.  Is that because they don't currently have this
information?  People don't want to add dependencies on them?
