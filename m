I/O port translations makes my head hurt, but I think you're right.

The raw I/O resources from ACPI _CRS are definitely different from the
Linux ioport spaces constructed by add_io_space(), so we shouldn't
compare the two.

If we need to validate the raw I/O ports from _CRS, I suppose in
theory we should be able to check that they're contained in the raw
I/O port range of an upstream window.

I think the problem is that 3772aea7d6f3 started applying the
x86-specific "[0-0xffff]" restriction to all arches, so if you want to 
back that out so it applies only on x86 (but to all devices, not just
PNP0A03), I think that would make sense.
