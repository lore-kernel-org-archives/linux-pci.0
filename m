It's great to see that the goal of this patch series is to configure 
interrupt affinity automatically for adapters that support multiple 
MSI-X vectors. However, is excluding these interrupts from irqbalanced 
really the way to go? Suppose e.g. that a system is equipped with two 
RDMA adapters, that these adapters are used by a blk-mq enabled block 
initiator driver and that each adapter supports eight MSI-X vectors. 
Should the interrupts of the two RDMA adapters be assigned to different 
CPU cores? If so, which software layer should realize this? The kernel 
or user space?

Sorry that I missed the first version of this patch series.

Thanks,

Bart.
