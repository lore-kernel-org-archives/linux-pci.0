There should be no need for a cpumap, nor should there be any need
for a lookup.  Driver will need the vector index for some admin ops,
but it can store it in it's driver-private queue structure (e.g. take
a look at the cq_vector field in NVMe).  Drivers really should not need
this during I/O, but if for some weird reason they do that driver specific
field is trivially reachable through the hw_ctx which gets passed to
->queue_rq.
