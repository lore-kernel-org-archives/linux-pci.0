Hello Keith,

Sorry that I had not yet this made this clear but my concern is about a 
system equipped with two or more adapters and with more CPU cores than 
the number of MSI-X interrupts per adapter. Consider e.g. a system with 
two adapters (A and B), 8 interrupts per adapter (A0..A7 and B0..B7), 32 
CPU cores and two NUMA nodes. Assuming that hyperthreading is disabled, 
will the patches from this patch series generate the following interrupt 
assignment?

0: A0 B0
1: A1 B1
2: A2 B2
3: A3 B3
4: A4 B4
5: A5 B5
6: A6 B6
7: A7 B7
8: (none)
...
31: (none)

The mapping I would like to see is as follows (assuming CPU cores 0..15 
correspond to NUMA node 0 and CPU cores 16..31 correspond to NUMA node 1):

0: A0
1: B0
2: (none)
3: (none)
4: A1
5: B1
6: (none)
7: (none)
8: A2
9: B2
10: (none)
11: (none)
12: A3
13: B3
14: (none)
15: (none)
...
31: (none)

Do you agree that - ignoring other interrupt assignments - that the 
latter interrupt assignment scheme would result in higher throughput and 
lower interrupt processing latency?

Thanks,

Bart.
