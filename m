Hi Bart,

Right, the kernel would be responsible for assigning interrupt vectors to
cores. The kernel is already responsible for setting the affinity hint,
but we want direct control because we can do a better than irqbalance,
which has been a problem point for users.

Many adapters gain significant performance when irqbalance is using
"exact" hint policy. But that's not irqbalance's default setting, and
we don't necessarily want to enforce "exact" on the entire system when
only a subset of devices benefit from such a setup.

I think the idea is have the irq_affinity mask match the CPU mapping on
the submission side context associated with that particular vector. If
two identical adapters generate the same submission CPU mapping, I don't
think we can do better than matching irq_affinity masks.

Thanks,
Keith
