Bjorn, what is your take on this?

Claiming the BAR resources associated with the efifb region from a
DECLARE_PCI_FIXUP_HEADER() handler does not seem to interfere with the
way resources are claimed later on. For arm64, we need this to ensure
that the BAR doesn't move, but for x86 this does not seem to be an
issue. This means we could potentially make the quirk ARM-only, but I
am a bit reluctant to do so and create even more divergence.

Thanks,
Ard.
