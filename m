At this point, I don't expect this to be enabled in any distribution. 
The use case is for custom hardware intended to do P2P which means they 
can have a custom kernel with P2P enabled. The default for 
CONFIG_PCI_P2P is 'no' and I expect it to stay that way for a long time.

Another boot option which has to be set for this to work isn't something 
we'd like to see.
