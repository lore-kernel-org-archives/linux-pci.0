Because you rely on behavior which is not defined by the C spec.

No, it does not guarantee that at all. Observed behavior != guarantee.
'Guarantee' implies that it is documented in a pertinent spec, and
that we can file a bug with the GCC/Clang projects if the behavior
changes at any point.

Nobody is asking you to theorize and make inferences about how
attribute X and behavior Y offer guarantee Z. All it takes is an
unambiguous quote from the C spec that describes how the struct
definition is mapped onto bits in memory. You have offered no such
quote, for which I don't blame you because I am convinced that the C
spec does not define this in sufficient detail.

No. For the last time, this patch will not be merged. The only
approach that will be merged is keeping the char[3] array and
inverting the order of the printk() arguments.
