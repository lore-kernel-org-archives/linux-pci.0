There have been out of tree patches using P2P DMA for a long time, and
some of the use cases have nothing to do with 'memory' - eg DMA to
'registers'

I notice that this series particularly focus on treating the target
BAR as 'memory' - ie it puts genalloc on top of the BAR, and I guess
treat all addresses as equal and interchangable.

If this series gets accepted I would expect proposals to extend this
infrastructure to allow for P2P for registers in some way as well.

So I think the 'p2pmem' name is a good choice only when it is in
places that talk about the genalloc part of this design.

We should reserve p2pdma to talk about the generic infrastructure
unrelated to the genalloc pool.

Since these sysfs's seem to report the genalloc pool status, p2pmem
seems like a good choice to me.

Don't most of the failure paths inside sysfs_create_group cause prints
anyhow?
