Ok, so the kernel - by that I mean both the baremetal and guest kernel -
needs to know whether we're encrypting stuff. So it needs to know about
SME.

Ok, so the guest needs to map its pages encrypted.

Which reminds me, KSM might be a PITA to enable with SEV but that's a
different story. :)

Right, and I'd like to keep those areas where it differs at minimum and
nicely cordoned off from the main paths.

So looking back at the current patch in this subthread:

we do check

* CPUID 0x40000000
* 8000_001F[EAX] for SME
* 8000_001F[EBX][5:0] for the encryption bits.

So how about we generate the following CPUID picture for the guest:

CPUID_Fn8000001F_EAX = ...10b

That is, SME bit is cleared, SEV is set. This will mean for the guest
kernel that SEV is enabled and you can avoid yourself the 0x40000000
leaf check and the additional KVM feature bit glue.

10b configuration will be invalid for baremetal as - I'm assuming - you
can't have SEV=1b with SME=0b. It will be a virt-only configuration and
this way you can even avoid the hypervisor-specific detection but do
that for all.

Hmmm?
