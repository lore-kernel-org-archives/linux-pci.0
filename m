The pci_claim_resource() call fails like this

pci 0000:01:01.0: can't claim BAR 0 [mem 0x10000000-0x10ffffff pref]:
no compatible bridge window
pci 0000:01:01.0: BAR 0: failed to claim resource for efifb!

which is caused by the fact that the parent resources are all zeroes.
It appears the BAR configuration is never read from the bridges, so
the only way we will ever have meaningful values in there is if we
allocate them ourselves.

So what are the pros and cons here? EFI fb is not a hugely important
use case, but it is one that relies on BARs staying where they are.
Are there others like that?

No, it doesn't. But that doesn't mean we shouldn't solve it on ACPI if
the pros outweigh the cons.

So how is this specific to ARM then? If we are running the same
resource allocation routines, why should we end up with a firmware
allocation that the kernel cannot use?

Well, some of them :-)

I guess the question was if the overridden __weak methods are supposed
to hook into tables or other BIOS structures that contain information
about the PCI resource allocations by the firmware.

The reason is to eliminate another unknown from the discussion whether
UEFI can be expected to leave the entire PCI hierarchy in a sane
state.

I would like to see it, yes.
