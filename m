After long period of testing, I now can say, that max_sectors_kb can be
set to 1024 - higher values produce AMD-Vi IO_PAGE_FAULTS and ata faults.


This patch "sd: Fix maximum I/O size for BLOCK_PC requests"[1] as part
of 4.1.7 produces ata / AMD-Vi IO_PAGE_FAULTS already during boot, too -
no matter if "block: remove artifical max_hw_sectors cap"[2] has been
applied or not.


Next I tested was "dm crypt: constrain crypt device's max_segment_size
to PAGE_SIZE" patch[3] applied to an unchanged 4.1.7 kernel w/o setting
max_sectors_kb to 1024.

Interesting effect was, that booting has been fine, but I could see lots
of ata errors afterwards as soon as there is load on the md raid 1
(during kernel compile e.g.), which is built on *rotational* disks:

Iow: Using an unpatched kernel >= 3.19 means high risk to break
filesystems if there are given some yet unknown conditions [4].

Until now, I didn't hear anything from the maintainers of AMD-Vi.
