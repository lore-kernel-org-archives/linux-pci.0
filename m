s/Christogh/Christoph/ (also above)

What tree would you prefer?  I vote for the IRQ tree since that seems
to be where the interesting parts are, and I think I acked all the PCI
bits.

Maybe include something more informative than just "reserved", e.g.,
"Don't apply affinity to @pre_vectors at beginning of MSI-X vector
space" or "Vectors at beginning of MSI-X vector space that are exempt
from affinity"?
