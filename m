Please read the top of pci_ids.h.  It hasn't had new ids added to it in
a long time.

It did for the USB gadget driver patch that I commented on.

Why would userspace need the pci id of anything?  Again, just use
libpci, isn't it fast enough?  Don't duplicate existing logic.

Or use the hw database that libudev exports, which is already on your
machine and exports all of the pci ids from libpci directly.

Again, why does userspace need this?
