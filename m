Ah, ok, I didn't think it was the endpoint that had to implement ATS.
But in that case, for our application, we need NVMe cards and RDMA NICs
to all have ATS support and I expect that is just as unlikely. At least
none of the endpoints on my system support it. Maybe only certain GPUs
have this support.
