No it does not mandate that at all. It mandates how the core should be
configured when running in UEFI, but the OS can do anything it likes.

We are still interested in adding limited UEFI support to big endian
arm64 in the future (i.e., access to a limited set of firmware tables
but no runtime services), and I am not going to merge anything that
moves us away from that goal.

Indeed. I am aware we will need to add various endian-neutral
accessors in the future.

Stubbornness alone is not going to convince me. What *could* convince
me (although unlikely) is a quote from the C spec which explains why
it is 100% legal to make assumptions about how bitfields are projected
onto byte locations in memory.
