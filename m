OK, I'm struggling a bit with this code. As you know, it is not light
bedtime reading :-)

In any case, I am starting to see your point. While I am able to claim
most of the configuration by calling pci_bus_claim_resources() only
[modulo some I/O BARs for which I will send out a bugfix shortly], the
option ROM BARs are left disabled by UEFI, and so I end up with

pci 0000:00:01.0: PCI bridge to [bus 01]
pci 0000:00:02.0: PCI bridge to [bus 02]
pci 0000:00:03.0: PCI bridge to [bus 03]
pci 0000:02:01.0: can't claim BAR 6 [mem 0xffff0000-0xffffffff pref]:
no compatible bridge window
pci 0000:03:01.0: can't claim BAR 6 [mem 0xfffc0000-0xffffffff pref]:
no compatible bridge window

and everything else works fine.

Both PPC and x86 have similar code to infer from the BARs themselves
whether they were programmed, but in our case, it comes down to
checking whether a parent resource exists that covers the range.

It may still make sense to add support for the _DSM method, and leave
it to the firmware to tell the kernel whether the PCI configuration is
supposed to be correct, so I will send out an RFC for that as well.
