Next tests:
I didn't mount any filesystem on bootup located on the ssd (only the
rotational based mounts) -> no problem.

Next: I tried to add the partitions from the ssd to be mounted on boot -
one by one. As there where 4 partitions to be mounted from the ssd, the
errors came up again.

Next: You suspect the ssd as being bad. Therefore, I changed the ssd and
tested with KINGSTON SV300S37A240G. Result: Same as above - errors are
coming up if there are mounted more than 3 partitions at the same time.


Summary:
- --perf-submit_from_crypt_cpus --perf-same_cpu_crypt -> broken anyway
- rotational disks alone: it's ok
- more than 3 partitions on ssd Corsair Force GT -> broken
- more than 3 partitions on ssd KINGSTON SV300S37A240G -> broken
