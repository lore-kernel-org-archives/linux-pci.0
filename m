Hi Christoph,

One general comment. As result of this series there will be
three locations to store/point to affinities: IRQ descriptor,
MSI descriptor and PCI device descriptor.

IRQ and MSI descriptors merely refer to duplicate masks while
the PCI device mask is the sum of all its MSI interrupts' masks.

Besides, MSI descriptors and PCI device affinity masks are only
used just once - at MSI initialization.

Overall, it looks like some cleanup is possible here.
