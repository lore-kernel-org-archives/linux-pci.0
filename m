I suspect we're saying the same thing with slightly different words,
so I apologize if I'm beating a dead horse.

ioport_resource defines the universe of Linux ioport space.  Every
IORESOURCE_IO struct resource must be contained in ioport_resource.
Such a resource contains Linux ioport numbers, i.e., things that could
appear in /proc/ioports and could be passed as an argument to
request_region() and the inb()/outb() functions.

I'm stumbling over "the physical address at which the root bridges
decode IO space (which is what's contained in the resource)".

x86 host bridges typically just forward CPU-generated I/O port
transactions to PCI with no address translation, so it sounds like
you're talking about ia64/ARM64 bridges that decode CPU MMIO space and
turn accesses into PCI I/O transactions.  

If we start from a driver calling inb(), the driver supplies a Linux
ioport number "X".  On ia64 (and I assume ARM64 as well), inb()
performs an MMIO access to memory address "Y".  A host bridge consumes
that MMIO access and generates a corresponding PCI I/O transaction to
PCI ioport "Z".

It is indeed true that ioport_resource has nothing to do with memory
addresses like "Y".  But the driver (and this part of the ACPI
infrastructure) are dealing with ioport address "X", and that is
definitely in an IORESOURCE_IO struct resource.  The IORESOURCE_MEM
struct resource that contains "Y" is internal to the host bridge
driver and invisible to the device driver that's using inb().

For example, you could have something like this (with made-up
addresses):

  [io  0x0000-0xffff]              # Linux ioport space
  [mem 0x100000000-0x10000ffff]    # MMIO space consumed by host bridge
  [bus 0x0000-0xffff]              # PCI bus I/O transaction space

  [io  0x10000-0x1ffff]            # Linux ioport space ("X")
  [mem 0x200000000-0x20000ffff]    # MMIO space consumed by host bridge ("Y")
  [bus 0x0000-0xffff]              # PCI bus I/O transaction space ("Z")
