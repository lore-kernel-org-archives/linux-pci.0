The CPER header is defined in the UEFI spec and UEFI mandates that the
arch is little endian (UEFI r2.6, sec. 2.3.5, 2.3.6).

So your argument seems moot to me.  Am I missing something?  Do you
have another argument?

Moreover, the vendor_id and device_id fields are little endian as well
(PCI r3.0, sec. 6.1), yet there are no provisions in our CPER parser in
drivers/firmware/efi/cper.c to convert them to the endianness of the host.

It seems clumsy and unnecessary to me so I'd prefer the bitfield.
Please excuse my stubbornness.

Thanks,
