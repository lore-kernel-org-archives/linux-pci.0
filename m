Hi Arnd, thanks very much for your review and comments!

What arm32 code you are trying to untangle for example ?

Introduce pci_host_info here because I want to make the PCI scan interfaces
simple to host drviers, host drivers only need to call one scan
interface(pci_scan_host_bridge), but from your comments,
The combination pci_create_host_bridge() + pci_scan_xx()
seems to be more popular.

I hope platforms with ACPI or DT could both use pci_create_host_bridge().
Why we need to use two different ways to process it ?
