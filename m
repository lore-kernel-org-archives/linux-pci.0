Okay, I see. But as long as the request-size is not bigger than 128MB
(the biggest chunk the AMD IOMMU driver can map at once), I don't see
how the IOMMU driver could be at fault.

Which ATA driver is in use when this happens and are there instructions
on how to reproduce the issue?

Alternativly someone who can reproduce it should trace the calls to
__map_single and __unmap_single in the AMD IOMMU driver to find out
whether the addresses which the faults happen on are really mapped, or
at least requested from the AMD IOMMU driver.
