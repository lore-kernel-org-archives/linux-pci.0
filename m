Yes, I was about to write to you I noticed the same issue.

That (>=0x10003) check in generic code is an x86ism, it is wrong but
it is there and given that there are other potential
users of acpi_dev_ioresource_flags() this patch should
be dropped I do not want to trigger x86 regressions because
some IO resources are not filtered.

I am travelling, so can't have a proper look till next week,
Rafael, please drop this patch.

We can't do that, it may work on IA64 but the ioport_resource is a
chunk of address space on IA64/ARM64 that has nothing to do with
the physical address at which the root bridges decode IO space (which
is what's contained in the resource).

I will have a look next week, please drop this patch.

Thanks,
Lorenzo
