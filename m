I diagreed - if we deprecated functions the only thing that should
be mentioned is a "don't use these".

That's what earlier versions of the code did.  However due to the
fact that we want to avoid over-allocating the msix_vectors array
(minor) and get the vectors count of the affinity mask right (major,
as pointed out by you last time) I had to move the allocations inside
the helpers that loop around the atctual enablement.  I didn't want
to change the function to a different version of the algorithm just
before removing them relatively soon.  But given that strong preference
for changing these simple functions instead of duplicating them I've
changed that patch to do that now.

Indeed.  Avoiding this allocation makes these interfaces quite a bit
simpler.  It requires a few prep patches, but I think it's definitively
worth, so the next version will avoid the need for the msix_entry array.

Ok, fixed.

Ok, fixed.

Ok, fixed.
