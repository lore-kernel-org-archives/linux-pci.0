I'll next try to just boot from the rotational disk. If the problem
doesn't show up here, it could be SSD related, too.

Thanks for this hint.

I compiled this version and applied it and verified it, if it's really
in initrd. It was in initrd and the additional options where applied, too.

But: nothing changed with enabled ncq - exactly same problem as before
(w/ linux 3.19.8 + additional patches and Linux 4.1 - no difference in
behavior).

Maybe - maybe not.

I'm having another machine, which doesn't show the problem - but this
machine can't be compared w/ the failing machine, because the other
machine does have a totally different and easy setup (1 ssd crypted lvm
and 3 or 4 logical filesystems - that's it) - and it's much slower :-).

Here I'm  having: 3 disks (1 ssd, 2 x 3 TB rotational), 1 crypted SW
Raid 1 w/ LVM on the rotational disks, another LVM on the ssd and 29 (!)
logical volumes each with xfs and 8 CPU cores, which guarantee high
degree of parallelism. I'm not sure if this is a "usual" setup which is
tested heavily. The error always comes up while mounting the partitions
on boot. Reducing the amount of mounted partitions reduced the amount of
errors (AMD-Vi IO_PAGE_FAULTs).

I hope we can find the problem.
