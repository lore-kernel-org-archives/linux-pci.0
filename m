Actually this patch is included in RFCv2 series for the completeness.

The patch is already been reviewed and accepted in kvm upstream tree but it
was not present in the tip branch hence I cherry-picked into RFC so that we do
not break the build. SEV runtime behavior needs this patch. I have tried to
highlight it in cover letter. It was my bad that I missed fixing the Reviewed-by
tag during cherry picking. Sorry about that and will be extra careful next time around. Thanks
