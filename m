OK, looks like pci.txt should be fixed then.

Look at how they are used e.g. by QEMU, seabios, gpxe.
People want to say e.g. "find all network class devices".

This really depends on whether you want something else that
libpci provides. But if I just want e.g. standard class IDs,
I don't want to depend on libpci.

Same argument really.

Mostly because it has a userspace driver, or is emulating
a hardware device.

For example, the VFIO driver uses the PCI hardware formats
as it's userspace/kernel interface. This means I need
a ton of PCI constants in userspace. Most of them are
already in pci_regs.h, and so exported. No problem here.

However class and prog interface IDs are not, they
are in pci_ids.h

Would you support splitting pci_ids.h to
include/uapi/linux/pci_ids.h with standard headers
and include/linux/pci_ids.h with device/vendor
specific ones?
