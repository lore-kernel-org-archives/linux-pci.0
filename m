That's agreed but that's not where the problem is on IA64/ARM64 IO
ACPI descriptors parsing.

The problem is, that's the address like "Y" that are checked in
acpi_dev_ioresource_flags() with current PCI initialization flow.

IO ports number "X" are created in (IA64) add_io_space() that is
executed after acpi_pci_probe_root_resources() is called (see
arch/ia64/pci/pci.c), that's the code that, IIUC, translates an
IO resource containing a CPU physical address (which is the address
that is ioremapped) to an IO resource containing a port number *and*
a corresponding MEM resource.

The check that causes failures (>=0x10003) is carried out
on the "raw" IO resource parsed from ACPI, not the one crafted
in add_io_space().

The resource checked in acpi_dev_ioresource_flags() is created from
ACPI IO descriptor and does contain CPU physical MMIO addresses,
comparing it to a port number is bound to fail, they do NOT represent
the same thing, happy be corrected.

That's the reason why currently IA64 IO space is not working, and
this patch fixes it, please correct me if I am wrong.

I will write back next week with the commits sequence and logic that
led to the current failure, sorry for not being able to respond
more promptly and in a comprehensive way I need sometime to write up
my understanding of the problem and commit logs, I will do that
next week.

Thanks,
Lorenzo
