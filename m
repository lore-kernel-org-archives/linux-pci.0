I think this is another case of the HW can do it but the SW support is
missing. IOMMU configuration and maybe firmware too, for instance.

If I recall I saw a presentation that Coral was expected to use P2P
between the network and GPU.

Wouldn't surprise me at all to see broken implementations in
ARM64.. But even there it needs IOMMU enablement to work at all if I
recall.

Bascially, this is probably not a HW problem that needs a HW bit, but
a OS/firmware problem to do all the enablement..
