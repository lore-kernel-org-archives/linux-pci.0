Agree, I think it's better to use the [bus start - FF] instead of [00-FF].

It seems to have some problems in pci_scan_bus() if we have more than one pci host bridge
in a domain. Because we add the default busn_res[00-FF] to resource list in pci_scan_bus(),
and pass the resource list to pci_create_root_bus().  The pci root bus would
consume the bus range from the start to the 0xFF, and request it from the per-domain resource[00-FF].
So if we have another pci host bridge in this domain, and pass another start bus number, it would
fail when the root bus try to request bus resource from per-domain resource. Now only several archs
call pci_scan_bus(), I guess they didn't run the code in above case, so we didn't find
the bus report.

Per-domain resource pci_domain_busn_res is what we are looking for.
For simplicity, we could report a conflict and fail when we find a conflict bus
resource in system.

Allocate a new busn_res maybe unnecessary, the bus resource we added to resource list
and passed to pci_create_root_bus() will never be used again after we call
pci_bus_insert_busn_res(), we may could consider to use local busn_res in pci_scan_bus().
