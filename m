Alright, don't get mad at me.

I was hoping that we could have a technical discussion on whether the
proposed patch is technically correct, on all arches.  You seem to
dispute that, I maintain it.  I'd like to learn something new and was
hoping I'm not alone there.

I'm relying on the same behavior that the existing code relies on:

That 'packed' guarantees no padding if all struct members have a
size which is a multiple of full bytes.

So I'm not *adding* a GCC-ism.

I did quote the pertinent spec above, the source is:

https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-7.1.0/gcc/Common-Variable-Attributes.html

I thought I did prove that, let me try again:

C99 sec. 6.7.2.1:
	An implementation may allocate any addressable storage unit large
	enough to hold a bit-field.

=> So the bit-field could occupy more than 3 bytes.  Why doesn't it do
   that?  Because GCC's 'packed' attribute guarantees "the smallest
   possible alignment -- one byte for a variable, and one bit for a field".
   The existing declaration "__u8 class_code[3]" leverages that same
   guarantee.

Further in 6.7.2.1:

	If enough space remains, a bit-field that immediately follows
	another bit-field in a structure shall be packed into adjacent
	bits of the same unit. If insufficient space remains, whether
	a bit-field that does not fit is put into the next unit or
	overlaps adjacent units is implementation-defined. The order of
	allocation of bit-fields within a unit (high-order to low-order
	or low-order to high-order) is implementation-defined.

=> That's what I meant when I said it would be a different story if there
   were multiple consecutive bit-fields.  But in this case there's just
   a single bit-field surrounded by non-bit-fields.

Further in 6.7.2.1:

	Each non-bit-field member of a structure or union object is
	aligned in an implementation-defined manner appropriate to
	its type.

=> So the alignment of all the non-bit-field members is likewise
   solely enforced by gcc's 'packed' attribute.

Further in 6.7.2.1:

	Within a structure object, the non-bit-field members and the
	units in which bit-fields reside have addresses that increase
	in the order in which they are declared.

=> This should answer your question how struct members are projected
   onto byte locations in memory.

=> Bottom line is that the behavior both of the existing code, as well
   as of the proposed patch, relies on the semantics of gcc's 'packed'
   attribute.  Agree or disagree?

Forgot to mention, I tested with both clang and gcc.

Fine by me.

However I note that your original objection was based on the allegation
that the patch would move you away from your goal of implementing
endianness-mixed-mode on aarch64.

After I've shown that it does not, you're unconditionally saying no.

I respectfully submit that moving the goal posts like that may not be
the best approach to maintainership.

Thanks,

Lukas
