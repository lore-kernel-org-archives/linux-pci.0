Why not?  I'm not a user-space programmer, so it's not obvious to me
what the problems with adding a dependency are.  If a package provides
functionality you want, it seems like a *good* thing to use it and
depend on it rather than reimplementing the functionality yourself.

The /usr/include/pci/header.h supplied by libpci-dev (on Ubuntu) looks
like it has most or all of the constants you want.
