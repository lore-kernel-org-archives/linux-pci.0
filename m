What part do you think is incorrect?

Yes, in that case we'll assign imcompetely.  I've already heard people
complaining about that at LSF/MM, but no one volunteered patches.
I only have devices with 1 or enough vectores to test, so I don't
really dare to touch the algorithm.  Either way the algorithm
change should probably be a different patch than refactoring it and
moving it around.

We can't just return the pointer as NULL is a valid and common return
value.  If we pass the pointer we'd then also need to allocate one for
the (common) nvec = 1 case.

Thanks, fixed.

The function is intended to replicate the blk-mq algorithm.  I don't
think it's optimal, but I really want to avoid dragging the discussion
about the optimal algorithm into this patchset.  We should at least
move to a vector per node/socket model instead of just the siblings,
and be able to use all vectors (at least optionally).
