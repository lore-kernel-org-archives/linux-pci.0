This one isn't relevant as the problem is seen when we are acquiring 
resources, not releasing them.

This one is interesting, but I don't think it will work.

pci_claim_resource() calls pci_find_parent_resource(), which will fail 
in important use cases.

It is perfectly legal for a bridge provisioned by EA to not specify any 
resources.  In this case we must walk up the bus tree until we find 
something that contains the device resource, and can thus be a parent.

That is a big part of what my patch is doing.

As for the merits of assigning fixed resources from the FINAL fixup, 
rather than in __pci_bus_assign_resources(), I am unsure.

Thanks,
David Daney
