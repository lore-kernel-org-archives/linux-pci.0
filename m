I don't understand the comment.  If we only have one vector (of any
kinds) there is no need to create an affinity mask, we'll leave the
interrupt to the existing irq balancing code.

That's what the earlier versions did, but you correctly pointed out
that we should call irq_create_affinity_mask only after we have reduced
the number of vectors to the number that the bridges can route, i.e.
that we have to move it into the pci_enable_msi(x)_range main loop.

NVMe cares for all these cases at least in theory.

While these two pieces of code look very similar there is an important
difference in why and how the mask is calculated.  In alloc_descs()
the difference here is that cnt = 1 is the MSI-X case where the
passed in affinity is that for the MSI-X descriptor which is for
a single vector.  in the MSI case where we have multiple vectors per
descriptor a different affinity is asigned for each vector based
of a single passed in mask.
