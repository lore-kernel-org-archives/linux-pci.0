A wmb() is always required before operations that can trigger DMA.

The reason ARM has a barrier in writel() is not to make it ordered
with respect to CPU stores to cachable memory, but to make it ordered
with respect to *other* writels.

Eg Linux defines this:

writel(A, mem);
writel(B, mem);

To always produce two TLPs on PCI-E when mem is UC BAR memory.

And ARM cannot guarentee that without the extra barrier.

So now we see stuff like this:

writel_relaxed(A, mem);
writel_relaxed(B, mem+4);

Which says the TLPs to A and B can be issued in any order..

So when reading the above mlx code, we see the first wmb() being used
to ensure that CPU stores to cachable memory are visible to the DMA
triggered by the doorbell ring.

The mmiowb() is used to ensure that DB writes are not combined and not
issued in any order other than implied by the lock that encloses the
whole thing. This is needed because uar_map is WC memory.

We don't have ordering with respect to two writel's here, so if ARM
performance was a concern the writel could be switched to
writel_relaxed().

Presumably nvme has similar requirments, although I guess the DB
register is mapped UC not WC?
