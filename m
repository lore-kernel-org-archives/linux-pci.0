_BBN is not the correct source for the bridge's bus number range.  There's
a comment in acpi_pci_root_add() that explains why:

  * We need both the start and end of the downstream bus range
  * to interpret _CBA (MMCONFIG base address), so it really is
  * supposed to be in _CRS.  If we don't find it there, all we
  * can do is assume [_BBN-0xFF] or [0-0xFF].

A platform SHOULD know the start and and end bus number.  If it doesn't I
think it's the platform's responsibility to carve up the bus number range.
Maybe this can be done by trimming the range of the [bus 00-ff] bridge when
we discover another bridge that leads to bus 80.
