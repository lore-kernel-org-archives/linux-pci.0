This would be solved better by choosing the closest devices in the 
hierarchy in the p2pmem_find function (ie. preferring devices involved 
in the transaction). Also, based on the current code, it's a bit of a 
moot point seeing it requires all devices to be on the same switch. So 
unless you have a giant switch hidden somewhere you're not going to get 
too many NIC/NVME pairs.

In any case, we are looking at changing both those things so distance in 
the topology is preferred and the ability to span multiple switches is 
allowed. We're also discussing changing it to "user picks" which 
simplifies all of this.
