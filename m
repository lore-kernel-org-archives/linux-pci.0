Thanks for taking a look. I have been struggling with this issue for a
while now.

IIRC this was a late addition. I agree that the issue exists in theory
on x86 as well. However, I was primarily dealing with the reality of
arm64 systems that suddenly explode in inexplicable ways after
upgrading the kernel to one that happens to have EFIFB built in. The
patch went into -stable as well, so I still think adding #ifndef
CONFIG_X86 was the right choice here.

OK. The problem was that IORESOURCE_PCI_FIXED does not prevent the PCI
subsystem from handing out the same range to another device.

There is no such requirement in the spec. The graphics output protocol
is not described in terms of PCI, BARs etc. The framebuffer is simply
a memory range with side effects that is left enabled when handing
over to the OS.

In summary, I am as unhappy with the patch as you are, but it is still
an improvement over the previous situation, so let's simply
collaborate to get this into shape going forward.

My preference would be to investigate IORESOURCE_PCI_FIXED again,
because that still seems like the best way to deal with a live
framebuffer on a PCI device that has memory decoding enabled. It
should also address the issue with the current version of the patch,
i.e., that claiming resources at this point is not possible if the
device resides behind a bridge.

So is there any guidance you can give as to how to proceed? If we set
IORESOURCE_PCI_FIXED, how should be prevent the PCI layer from
assigning this resource elsewhere if we cannot claim it yet?

Regards,
Ard.
