Hello Christoph,

Today irqbalanced is responsible for deciding how to assign interrupts 
from different adapters to CPU cores. Does the above mean that for 
adapters that support multiple MSI-X interrupts the kernel will have 
full responsibility for assigning interrupt vectors to CPU cores?

If two identical adapters are present in a system, will these generate 
the same irq_affinity mask? Do you agree that interrupt vectors from 
different adapters should be assigned to different CPU cores if enough 
CPU cores are available? If so, which software layer will assign 
interrupt vectors from different adapters to different CPU cores?

Thanks,

Bart.
