Your concern was that a quirk would require a long list of device IDs
and we'd have to add new ones.  I share that concern, and my point was
that pci_d3_delay_fixup() checks for the platform type and sets the
delay based on that, so it doesn't have a long list of device IDs.  

Whether the appropriate delay is zero or 3 is a question for you Intel
guys to sort out.  We already have:

  pci_d3delay_fixup()     # arch/x86/pci/intel_mid_pci.c
  pci_d3_delay_fixup()    # drivers/staging/media/atomisp/platform/intel-mid/intel_mid_pcihelpers.c
  atomisp_pci_probe()     # drivers/staging/media/atomisp/pci/atomisp2/atomisp_v4l2.c

and you're proposing to add a fourth one.  I think there's a lot of
overlap there, and it'd be nice to clean that up.

If I don't use audio, I don't need the driver.  My concern is that
even without the driver, there may be paths that use
pci_dev_d3_sleep() for this device, e.g., suspend/resume of the whole
system.  If that's the case, we should avoid the default 10ms delay
even if there's no driver loaded.

Maybe we never use pci_dev_d3_sleep() if there's no driver, but I
haven't been able to convince myself of that yet.
