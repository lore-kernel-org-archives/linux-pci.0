Thanks for the work!
So really my only issue with this is that there's no
way for the IOMMU to describe the devices that it
covers.

As a result that is then done in a platform-specific way.

And this means that for example it does not solve the problem that e.g.
some power people have in that their platform simply does not have a way
to specify which devices are covered by the IOMMU.

Solving that problem would make me much more excited about
this device.

On the other hand I can see that while there have been some
developments most of the code has been stable for quite a while now.

So what I am trying to do right about now, is making a small module that
loads early and pokes at the IOMMU sufficiently to get the data about
which devices use the IOMMU out of it using standard virtio config
space.  IIUC it's claimed to be impossible without messy changes to the
boot sequence.

If I succeed at least on some platforms I'll ask that this design is
worked into this device, minimizing info that goes through DT/ACPI.  If
I see I can't make it in time to meet the next merge window, I plan
merging the existing patches using DT (barring surprises).

As I only have a very small amount of time to spend on this attempt, If
someone else wants to try doing that in parallel, that would be great!
