And you can still easily set this use case up by chosing less queues
(aka interrupts) than CPUs and assining your workload to the other
cores.

I'd say let's do such an interface incrementall based on the use
case - especially after we get networking over to use common code
to distribute the interrupts.  If you were doing something like this
with the current blk-mq code it wouldn't work very well due to the
fact that you'd have a mismatch between the assigned interrupt and
the blk-mq queue mapping anyway.

It might be a good idea to start brainstorming how we'd want to handle
this change - we'd basically need a per-device notification that the
interrupt mapping changes so that we can rebuild the queue mapping,
which is somewhat similar to the lib/cpu_rmap.c code used by a few
networking drivers.  This would also help with dealing with cpu
hotplug events that change the cpu mapping.
