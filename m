Ok, that is at least a step in the right direction. But I think we 
seriously need to test that for side effects.

Well I'm not an expert on this, but if I'm not completely mistaken that 
is not correct.

E.g. transactions are initially send to the root complex for 
translation, that's for sure. But at least for AMD GPUs the root complex 
answers with the translated address which is then cached in the device.

So further transactions for the same address range then go directly to 
the destination.

What you don't want is device isolation, cause in this case the root 
complex handles the transaction themselves. IIRC there where also 
something like "force_isolation" and "nobypass" parameters for the IOMMU 
to control that behavior.

It's already late here, but going to dig up the documentation for that 
tomorrow and/or contact a hardware engineer involved in the ACS spec.

Regards,
Christian.
