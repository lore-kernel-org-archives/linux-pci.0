Subject: [PATCH v4 0/5] nfs: modernize direct I/O path

	Anna Schumaker <anna@kernel.org>

Content-Type: text/plain; charset="UTF-8"

Modernize the NFS Direct I/O path as a preparatory step to enable PCI
Peer-to-Peer DMA (P2PDMA) support. Following feedback on the initial
RFC [1], the modernization and architectural changes are split into
different series. Additionally, based on the discussion in the v2 [2]
of this series, the migration of NFS Direct I/O to folios would be
handled in a separate follow-up series.

Currently, NFS O_DIRECT relies on the legacy iov_iter_get_pages_alloc2()
API which does not support the pinning requirements for P2P memory.
The implementation moves NFS to the modern iov_iter_extract_pages() API.

Design
======

1. Pin-Awareness
Standard NFS requests use get_page() and put_page() for memory
management. However, memory extracted via iov_iter_extract_pages()
requires explicit pinning.

Introduce a PG_PINNED flag and a wb_nr_pinned count to struct nfs_page.
This allows the request lifecycle to track ownership of physical pins
and ensure that unpinning is performed only when the I/O is complete.

2. API Migration
Migrate the Direct I/O path to the modern iov_iter_extract_pages()
API. This aligns NFS with the modern extraction model and serves as
the foundation for passing ITER_ALLOW_P2PDMA in a follow-up series.

Upcoming Work / Roadmap
================================

As decided in the RFC [1] & v2 [2], there will be separate series for
P2PDMA Enablement and Migrating NFS Direct I/O to use folios.

This series lays the necessary groundwork for the upcoming work.
Following this, two additional series are planned:

1. Migrating NFS Direct I/O to Folios
A series that introduces and exports helper from iov_iter.c to allow
the nfs_direct_extract_pages() helper introduced here to aggregate
multiple pages into a single large folio-based request, aiming to reduce
the RPC overhead for hugepage I/O.

2. P2PDMA Enablement for NFS
Enabling ITER_ALLOW_P2PDMA for the Direct I/O path and introducing transport-level
negotiation (discovery of P2P-capable RDMA/NVMe devices). This will build
upon the PG_PINNED infrastructure introduced by this series.

Testing
=======
This series has been tested with xfstests [3] on RDMA & TCP transports
by running the quick test suite for each transport vs. version combo:

./check -g quick -s rdma3 -s rdma40 -s rdma41 -s rdma42 -s tcp3 -s tcp40 -s tcp41 -s tcp42

The tests were run before & after applying the series. No regressions were observed. 

The following summary was tabulated via a custom script [4] (on github)
to depict that the tests failing in v1 [5] are now passing.
