IMO it's unnecessary detail to say it's synthetized. For <= PCIe r3.0, 
kernel does indeed synthetize something, but that "supported speeds" which 
is a set of values. pcie_get_speed_cap() used in max_link_speed_show() 
only returns the max value out of that set which, for sane devices, should 
be same as Max Link Speed.

The speed may also be capped by Target Link Speed in Link Control 2 that 
is under control of PCIe BW Controller (bwctrl).
