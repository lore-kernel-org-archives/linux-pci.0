Works fine here. Thanks.


But now, I can see the next big problem of v4.3-rc4: My VMs are
connected on the host via tun/tap devices. They themselves are connected
to a bridge device. If there is data sent between the VMs, the (system)
load is more as double (!) of the load seen with 4.1.x e.g. . Having an
allover throughput of about low 35 MBit/s seen by the host over all
tun/tap devices / bridge creates a load of 3 (!!) with 3 VMs being
involved. That's about half of the load produced by kernel compiling
(make -j8).
