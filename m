I was thinking of doing something like this. I'll probably rough out a 
patch and send it along today or tomorrow.

Well, creating the extra op doesn't really change anything to the RDMA 
patch in this series. The point is, for the time being, we need to track 
whether we are doing a P2P or normal mapping using a side channel as we 
don't have a good way of tracking it in the SGL at this time.

Adding an extra DMA op is just one way to allow the existing DMA 
providers to opt-in/out.
