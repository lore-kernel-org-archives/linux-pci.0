Well I'm not an expert on this, but I think that is an incorrect 
assumption you guys use here.

At least in the default configuration even with IOMMU enabled P2P 
transactions does NOT necessary travel up to the root complex for 
translation.

It's already late here, but if nobody beats me I'm going to dig up the 
necessary documentation tomorrow.

Christian.

> We had a pretty lengthy discussion on this topic on one of the previous revisions. The issue is that currently there is no mechanism in the IOMMU code to inform VMs if IOMMU groupings change. Since p2pdma can dynamically change its topology (due to PCI hotplug) we had to be cognizant of the fact that ACS settings could change. Since there is no way to currently handle changing ACS settings and hence IOMMU groupings the consensus was to simply disable ACS on all ports in a p2pdma domain. This effectively makes all the devices in the p2pdma domain part of the same IOMMU grouping. The plan will be to address this in time and add a mechanism for IOMMU grouping changes and notification to VMs but that's not part of this series. Note you are still allowed to have ACS functioning on other PCI domains so if you do not a plurality of IOMMU groupings you can still achieve it (but you can't do p2pdma across IOMMU groupings, which is safe).

If not you are not getting all the performance benefit (due to IOMMU routing), if you are then there are obviously security implications between those IOMMU domains if they are assigned to different VMs. And now the issue is if new devices are added and the p2p topology needed to change there would be no way to inform the VMs of any IOMMU group change.
