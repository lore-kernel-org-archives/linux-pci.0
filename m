I propose making this part of base Linux system headers, yes.

BTW it's not a third location actually. It would be a third location in a
library, but there are many other packages that duplicate this code.
Since we have this code around anyway, if we just export it, then
there's hope that with time all this duplicate code will go away, then
when e.g. a new value is added to spec, people will add it to linux and
everyone benefits.  As I work on QEMU, I know QEMU will do it,
likely bios and gpxe too, I expect libpci/libudev to be no different.

Yes: build-time dependencies annoy developers, run-time ones annoy users :)
In a sense build-time dependencies are more annoying as it's harder to
resolve them.
