This is strange... Do I understand it correctly that this bug appears only
if you mount more than 3 encrypted partitions? (IOW if you mount only 2 or 3
there is no problem?)

ok. I guess it was just image of the same disk on different hw, correct?

That is even more interesting because these should effectively disable
the parralel submit code in dmcrypt.

Could you please verify that these flags are really applied when you used
them? (I am just trying to eliminate possible cryptsetup bug, the code is new).
(Run dmsetup table, you should see submit_from_crypt_cpus/same_cpu_crypt
on the dmcrypt mappping table line according to commandline.)

- if you disable NCQ, the problems goes away?

Could you please post "lsblk" and dmesg output from the situation which fails,
(with mounted >3 partition on boot)?
I think someone should defititely try to reproduce it on some development hw here,
configured storage stack should be visible from the lsblk output.

Thanks for for the info & tests!

Milan
