Yes, that seems to be what is happening.

I did a quick test with calling request_mem_region(), in which case we
end up with something like

10000000-3efeffff : PCI Bus 0000:00
  10000000-101d4bff : efifb:pci
  101d5000-101d5fff : 0000:00:01.0
  101d6000-101d6fff : 0000:00:02.0
  101d7000-101d7fff : 0000:00:04.0
    101d7000-101d7fff : ehci_hcd
  101d8000-101d8fff : 0000:00:05.0
  101e0000-101effff : 0000:00:05.0
  10200000-1023ffff : 0000:00:02.0

which works, because the region is no longer assigned to another BAR.

But I think claiming the resource via the PCI subsystem is probably
more appropriate, because then we get

10000000-3efeffff : PCI Bus 0000:00
  10000000-10ffffff : 0000:00:05.0
    10000000-101d4fff : efifb
  11000000-1103ffff : 0000:00:02.0
  11040000-1104ffff : 0000:00:05.0
  11050000-11050fff : 0000:00:01.0
  11051000-11051fff : 0000:00:02.0
  11052000-11052fff : 0000:00:04.0
    11052000-11052fff : ehci_hcd
  11053000-11053fff : 0000:00:05.0

(Note that efifb does not use the entire BAR resource)

I will spin a v3 with the check and the claim in reverse order. But I
think we should keep the pci_claim() call.
