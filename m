The intent of pci_add_resource() and passing the resulting resource list
into pci_scan_root_bus(), etc., is that the host bridge may consume any
resources described by the list.  If we pass the same resource to multiple
calls, that means the resource must be shared between the multiple host
bridges involved.  For bus numbers, that makes some sense if the platform
considers the bridges to be in the same domain, but not if they are in
different domains.

If we export busn_resource, we have no control over what domains it becomes
associated with because the domain is passed into pci_scan_root_bus() by
the caller.
