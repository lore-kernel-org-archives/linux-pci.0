Perfectly. Seems to work w/ 3.19.8 and your mentioned patches. But now,
I'm getting another error, which I didn't see before w/ 3.x-kernels:

[drm:btc_dpm_set_power_state [radeon]] *ERROR*
rv770_restrict_performance_levels_before_switch failed

It seams that your patches do have some unwanted side effects :-).

Could you please reexamine your patch "dm crypt: don't allocate
pages for a partial request" - after applying this patch all the
problems are coming up here.



Thanks,
regards,
Andreas
