I don't agree with that at all. It's a "is my request valid" helper,
it's not some obscure and rarely used functionality. You're making up
this API right now, if you really want it done for every IO, make it
part of the p2p submission process. You could even hide it behind a
debug thing, if you like.

If you're adamant about having it in common code, put it in your
common submission code. Most folks aren't going to care about P2P, let the
ones that do have the checks.
