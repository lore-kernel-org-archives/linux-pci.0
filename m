Yes, and I'd like that to be done with a new data section rather than a
special KVM hook.

I have no idea.  SEV-ES seems to be very hard to set up at the beginning
of the kernel bootstrap.  There's all sorts of chicken and egg problems,
as well as complicated handshakes between the firmware and the guest,
and the way to do it also depends on the trust and threat models.

A much simpler way is to just boot under a trusted hypervisor, do
"modprobe sev-es" and save a snapshot of the guest.  Then you sign the
snapshot and pass it to your cloud provider.
