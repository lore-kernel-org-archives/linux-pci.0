However personally I would prefer including the option of a run-time kernel parameter too. In fact a few months ago I proposed a small patch that did just that [1]. It never really went anywhere but if people were open to the idea we could look at adding it to the series.

One does not have access to the kernel command-line w/o a few privs.
A CONFIG option prevents a distribution to have a default, locked-down kernel _and_ the ability to be 'unlocked' if the customer/site is 'secure' via other means.
A run/boot-time option is more flexible and achieves the best of both.

Well, p2p DMA is a function of a cooperating 'agent' somewhere above the two devices.
That agent should 'request' to the kernel that ACS be removed/circumvented (p2p enabled) btwn two endpoints.
I recommend doing so via a sysfs method.

That way, the system can limit the 'unsecure' space btwn two devices, likely configured on a separate switch, from the rest of the still-secured/ACS-enabled PCIe tree.
PCIe is pt-to-pt, effectively; maybe one would have multiple nics/fabrics p2p to/from NVME, but one could look at it as a list of pairs (nic1<->nvme1; nic2<->nvme2; ....).
A pair-listing would be optimal, allowing the kernel to figure out the ACS path, and not making it endpoint-switch-switch...-switch-endpt error-entry prone.
Additionally, systems that can/prefer to do so via a RP's IOMMU, albeit not optimal, but better then all the way to/from memory, and a security/iova-check possible,
can modify the pt-to-pt ACS algorithm to accomodate over time (e.g., cap bits be they hw or device-driver/extension/quirk defined for each bridge/RP in a PCI domain).

Kernels that never want to support P2P could build w/o it enabled.... cmdline option is moot.
Kernels built with it on, *still* need cmdline option, to be blunt that the kernel is enabling a feature that could render the entire (IO sub)system unsecure.

> By this you mean the address for either a RP, DSP, USP or MF EP below which we disable ACS? We could do that but I don't think it avoids the issue of changes in IOMMU groupings as devices are added/removed. It simply changes the problem from affecting and entire PCI domain to a sub-set of the domain. We can already handle this by doing p2pdma on one RP and normal IOMMU isolation on the other RPs in the system.
> 
as devices are added, they start in ACS-enabled, secured mode.
As sysfs entry modifies p2p ability, IOMMU group is modified as well.


btw -- IOMMU grouping is a host/HV control issue, not a VM control/knowledge issue.
        So I don't understand the comments why VMs should need to know.
        -- configure p2p _before_ assigning devices to VMs. ... iommu groups are checked at assignment time.
           -- so even if hot-add, separate iommu group, then enable p2p, becomes same IOMMU group, then can only assign to same VM.
        -- VMs don't know IOMMU's & ACS are involved now, and won't later, even if device's dynamically added/removed

Is there a thread I need to read up to explain /clear-up the thoughts above?
