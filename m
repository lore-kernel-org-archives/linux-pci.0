So you want us to create yet-a-third-location for these values?  Both
libpci and libudev are on all systems.  And it's not a run-time
dependancy you are talking about here, but a build-time one, which is
quite different.  Having a build-time dependancy on packages that ship
with all Linux distributions seems acceptable to me.
