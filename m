git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/helgaas/pci.git
pci/enumeration-yw6 has similar code (it exports the single
busn_resource and makes xen use it).  That should be functionally
identical to what v4.0-rc1 does.

Yijing hasn't posted the static busn_res proposal above yet, so I
don't have a branch with that in it.
