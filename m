fixed.

fixed a swell.

Which driver?  One of the points here is to get this sort of code out
of drivers and into common code..

There have been some reports about the blk-mq IRQ distribution being
suboptimal, but no one sent patches so far.  This patch just moves the
existing algorithm into the core code to be better bisectable.

I think an algorithm that takes cores into account instead of just SMT
sibling would be very useful.  So if you have a case where this helps
for you an incremental patch (or even one against the current blk-mq
code for now) would be appreciated.
