Well, if you are using the standard MdeModulePkg PciHostBridgeDxe
driver in UEFI, the logic is quite similar, and so you usually end up
with the same resource assignments. But the kernel does recompute them
from scratch, and ignores the existing configuration that is present
in the BARs

If you have working EFIFB on your platform, it works by accident. This
patch is needed to ensure that the BAR associated with the EFI
framebuffer is left untouched.
