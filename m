Sorry about keeping this thread alive, I'm just trying
to wrap my head around what you consider a sane API.

Linux used not to export headers automatically, generally.
It used to be "just use libc". Why is this header different?

These constants are required to use the interfaces
linux does export to userspace, including VFIO and sysfs.
No one maintains them really, though libpci has a copy
of these.

Some people believe headers are copyrighteable, for them, licensing is
also problematic: libpci is under plain GPL, Linux needs the exception
for user programs.  Does not this mean that we can't depend on libpci to
provide parts of linux/userspace interface?

So add libpci dependency just for the headers?  No one wants to do this.
Case in point, Linux doesn't want to depend on libpci headers either, right?
Why not? why not make it a build dependency? I don't really propose this,
but exactly the same logic applies to gpxe or seabios.
People that don't link with libpci don't want to make it
a build dependency.

I don't think class IDs or vendor IDs ever did or can change.
New stuff is added, we add it as we add Linux support.
Isn't this a good reason to include this? Will push
vendors to work with the community instead of
around it using userspace drivers.
