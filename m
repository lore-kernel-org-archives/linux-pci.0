Hmmm, I retested this morning w/ v4.3-rc4 and 4.1.10 (with the above
mentioned patch applied) - and now, I didn't get any more ata errors.

I'm confused now. The only difference between yesterday evening and this
morning was, that the machine was over night completely powerless (via
socket outlet switch). Could this really be the reason? Let's wait and
see if this is a persistent state ... .

But the other new error w/ 4.3-rc-2 or 4 while starting a VM with PCI
passthrough remains even this morning :-(. Would have been nice if it
would have gone over night, too ...


Thanks,
regards,
Andreas
