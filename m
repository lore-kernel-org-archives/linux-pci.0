Nothing changed on radeon code. I just applied your patches. Nothing 
more. Why should radeon been suddenly broken if I apply your patches to 
a stable 3.19.8 code?

These patches trigger tons of AMD-Vi IO_PAGE_FAULTs w/ ncq enabled and 
the IOMMU developers say, that it is not a problem of the iommu code.

Maybe - maybe not. The only thing I know for sure, is: with these 
patches applied, the machine doesn't work reliably any more. W/ ncq 
disabled, the AMD-Vi IO_PAGE_FAULTs are gone, but a radeon error never 
seen before came instead. Most probably chance. Most probably, it could 
have been risen any other error, too.

I am willing to do tests if you have any idea to be tested - I can 
reproduce it quite easily.


Thanks,
