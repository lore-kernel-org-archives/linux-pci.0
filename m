Currently, if platform does not know the end bus number (not provide the bus resource),
we will update the max bus number returned by pci_scan_child_bus() to the bus resource end,
and I think this is reasonable. I consider to introduce a flag to identify the bus resource
which end bus number is undefined, then we could force all pci_scan_root_bus()  etc. callers
to provide the bus resource, and we could process the bus resource end according the bus resource flag.
Also then we could reduce the bus argument which is the same as busn_res->start.
I would try to provide draft patch, then we could discuss it more clearly.

Thanks!
