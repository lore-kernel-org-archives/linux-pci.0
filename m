No need to get personal on that. I did specify that this was based on
some incomplete understanding of what's going on with that new hack
used to create struct pages.

As it is, it cannot work on ppc64 however, in part because according to
Oliver, we end up mapping things cachable, and in part, because of the
address range issues.

The latter issue might be fundamental to the approach and unfixable
unless we have ways to use hooks for virt_to_page/page_address on these
things.

Ben.
