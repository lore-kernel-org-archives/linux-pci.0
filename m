It's legal to initialize a field multiple times, and the last one
takes precedence, so doing this might at least avoid the full tree
sweeps:

  static struct msi_domain_ops vmd_msi_domain_ops = {
    MSI_DOMAIN_DEFAULT_OPS,
    .get_hwirq = vmd_get_hwirq,
  };

The functions referenced by MSI_DOMAIN_DEFAULT_OPS would still have to
be exported, though.

I'm OK with __ro_after_init, at least as an interim solution.

I do think it would be good to audit all the uses of
MSI_FLAG_USE_DEF_DOM_OPS and MSI_FLAG_USE_DEF_CHIP_OPS, since they
seem to be the primary indicator of when the struct might be modified.
I suspect we could add __ro_after_init to more than just pci-hyperv.c,
vmd.c, and msi.c
