It does, sort of - but in a different way then the normal DMA map
ops.  And only to work around the fact that we need to map our
P2P space into struct pages.  Without that we could just pass the
bus address around, but the Linux stack and VM isn't anywhere near
ready for something that advanced.

Maybe once root complexes with iommus actually support P2P.  But until
then we have a lot more more important problems to solve.
