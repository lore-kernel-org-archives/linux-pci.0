A network driver, i40e. I'd be glad to implement/see some common code to 
raise the topology information I need, but I was implementing on i40e 
more as a test case/toy example heheh...

...but now I'll focus on the common/general case! Thanks for the 
suggestion Christoph. I guess would be even better to have a generic 
function that retrieves an optimal mask, something like 
topology_get_optimal_mask(n, *cpumask), in which we get the best 
distribution of n CPUs among all cores and return such a mask - 
interesting case is when n < num_online_cpus. So, this function could be 
used inside your irq_create_affinity_mask() and maybe in other places it 
is needed.

I was planning to use topology_core_id() to retrieve the core of a CPU, 
if anybody has a better idea, I'd be glad to hear it.

Cheers,


Guilherme
