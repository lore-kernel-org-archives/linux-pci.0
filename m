PCI: hv: Probe vPCI buses asynchronously
   =20
On Hyper-V guests each virtual PCI bus is enumerated by its own
hv_pci_probe() call. The probe performs several synchronous host
request/response exchanges while negotiating the protocol, querying bus
relations, entering D0, and reporting allocated resources.

[Severity: High]
This is a pre-existing issue, but I noticed a potential memory leak of child
PCI device structures (struct hv_pci_dev) in the error paths of
hv_pci_probe() in drivers/pci/controller/pci-hyperv.c.

If hv_pci_enter_d0() fails, the error path jumps directly to
release_state_lock:

    ret =3D hv_pci_enter_d0(hdev);
    if (ret)
        goto release_state_lock;

This completely skips hv_pci_bus_exit(), which is responsible for unlinking
and freeing the children.

Additionally, if an error occurs earlier and it jumps to exit_d0, it calls
hv_pci_bus_exit() but skips freeing the devices:

exit_d0:
    (void) hv_pci_bus_exit(hdev, true);
release_state_lock:
    mutex_unlock(&hbus->state_lock);

The keep_devs=3Dtrue argument explicitly skips freeing the children.

In both situations, the hbus structure is subsequently freed, leaving the
previously populated hbus->children list permanently leaked. Could these
error paths be adjusted to ensure child devices are properly freed?

[Severity: High]
This is a pre-existing issue, but could a workqueue be leaked in
hv_pci_remove() if hv_pci_resume() had previously failed?

In drivers/pci/controller/pci-hyperv.c:hv_pci_resume(), hbus->state is
initially set to hv_pcibus_init. If a subsequent operation fails, the
function returns an error without restoring the state.

Later, when the device is removed, hv_pci_remove() checks the state before
destroying the workqueue:

    if (hbus->state =3D=3D hv_pcibus_installed) {
        tasklet_disable(&hdev->channel->callback_event);
        hbus->state =3D hv_pcibus_removing;
        tasklet_enable(&hdev->channel->callback_event);
        destroy_workqueue(hbus->wq);
        hbus->wq =3D NULL;
        ...

Since the state was left as hv_pcibus_init, this block is bypassed, and
the workqueue is leaked when hbus is later freed. Does this state check need
to be modified to ensure the workqueue is always destroyed on removal?

[Severity: Critical]
This is a pre-existing issue, but can VMBus transaction mappings be left
dangling when wait_for_response() aborts early, leading to a Use-After-Free
upon delayed host completion?

In drivers/pci/controller/pci-hyperv.c, several functions allocate a
struct pci_packet on the stack or heap, pass it to the VMBus requestor,
and then wait for a response. For example, in new_pcichild_device():

    if (wait_for_response(hbus->hdev, &comp_pkt.host_event))
        goto error;

Or in hv_pci_enter_d0():

    ret =3D wait_for_response(hdev, &comp_pkt.host_event);
    if (ret)
        goto exit;

Similar early returns occur in hv_read_config_block() and
hv_write_config_block().

If wait_for_response() aborts immediately (e.g. returning -ENODEV due to a
channel rescind), the caller returns and destroys its stack frame or frees
the heap allocation.

However, the transaction ID mapping remains in the VMBus requestor. If the
host sends a completion packet just after this, the hv_pci_onchannelcallbac=
k()
tasklet will retrieve the dangling pointer and execute its completion_func,
corrupting the stack or heap.

Should these functions use vmbus_request_addr_match() to remove the mapping
on failure, similar to how hv_pci_bus_exit() handles it?
