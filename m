Hmm, can you also test this again with the v4.3-rc4 please? The device
you are attaching has its own group and no aliases, so I really can't
see how the trace could happen, and I can't reproduce it here either.

So I just want to make sure it is not a follow-on bug from the previous
problem.


Thanks,

P.S.: When you build the kernel with debug symbols and the problem
      occurs again, you can find out the source file and line where the
      bug happened with

      	$ objdump -Dlz --start-address=<rip> vmlinux | head

      Replace <rip> with the RIP from the kernel oops and the output
      should show you where in the source the bug comes from. The
      vmlinux file is in the kernels build directory.
