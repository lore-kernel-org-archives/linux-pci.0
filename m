I don't actually need them in the block tree, but in the SCSI tree..
So the block tree is a bad place for this, that's why I initially
wanted you to pick it up.  But thinking about it the SCSI tree might
a better idea as we could avoid a non-bisectability with that.

I'll coordinate it with Jens and Martin and we'll leave you off the
hook.  Thanks for all the help!
