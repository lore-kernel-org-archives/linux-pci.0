I don't think it is a hardware problem.

I know Mellanox and Nvidia have been doing p2p on Intel root complexes
for something like 5-6 years now.. I don't have the details, but it
does seem to work.

I have heard some chips give poor performance..

Also AMD GPU SLI uses P2P these days, so this isn't exactly a niche
feature in Intel/AMD land.

I think the main issue here is that there is some BIOS involvement to
set things up properly. Eg in GPU land motherboards certify for
'crossfire' support.

If it is primarily a BIOS issue then it should be an ACPI thing, right?
