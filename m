There is something that I do not understand on how the resource
claiming works on x86. IIUC on x86, resource claiming is done in:

arch/x86/pci/legacy.c

pci_subsys_init()
 -> pcibios_init()
  -> pcibios_resource_survey()

pci_subsys_init() is run in a subsys_initcall.

Now, how do we ensure that resource claiming is carried out _after_
the PCI root busses have been actually scanned ?

The ACPI scan handler interface (so the interface to actually scan
a PCI root bridge in ACPI) is initialized in acpi_init() (which
is a subsys_initcall), how do we guarantee that is run before
pci_subsys_init() ?

x86 implements pcibios_resource_survey_bus(), but that's called only
for hotplugged bridges (?):

drivers/acpi/pci_root.c -> acpi_pci_root_add()

>From the log below, I see two options:

- x86 pcibios_resource_survey() is called before any root bus is added
  (so it does precious little)
- x86 pcibios_resource_survey() is called after root busses are added and
  the PCI device fixup has been applied (and the additional claim in it
  succeeds silently)

I am certainly missing something here, I will grab an x86 box to add
a couple of logs and see if my assumptions are correct, I would like
to get to the bottom of this, I think that's important.
