I did mention that this is trivial for scsi-mq, right?
The issue here is scsi-sq.
(Much as you despise it).

As long a scsi-mq is not the standard we _have_ to provide a way of 
retaining the original functionality which allowed for interrupt 
distribution even for scsi-sq.
Hence either the driver has to keep this functionality (looking up 
msi-index based on a give scsi command) internal within the driver or we 
provide a common function allowing drivers to look it up.

And my patch is aiming to provide the latter.
If you don't agree with it or think it'll be pointless, fine, I'll go 
ahead and modify the drivers.

Cheers,

Hannes
