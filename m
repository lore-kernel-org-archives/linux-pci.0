Right. And people asked explicitly to introduce these helpers when
range functions were introduced in the first place. Since there is
handful of drivers that do use pci_enable_msi*_exact() I suppose a
need for them persists.

I guess, it is up to Bjorn. But.

Your proposed pci_nr_irq_vectors() function (a) is not a replacement for
pci_msi*_vec_count() and (b) would be useless if I read its description
properly:

(a) Functions pci_msi*_vec_count() return number of vectors reported by
a PCI device. It is a constant for the device and a driver may make an
assumption based on this number;

(b) A number returned by pci_nr_irq_vectors() is not guaranteed what a
following call to pci_alloc_irq_vectors() can return (since the number
of actually allocated vectors might change between the two calls).
Therefore, a value returned by pci_nr_irq_vectors() can not be used for
anything.
