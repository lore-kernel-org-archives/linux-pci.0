The interrupts automatically spread based on which CPU submitted the
work. If you want to spread interrupts across more CPUs, then you can
spread submissions to the CPUs you want to service the interrupts.

Completing work on the same CPU that submitted it is quickest with
its cache hot access. I have equipment available to demo this. What
affinty_mask policy would you like to see compared with the proposal?
