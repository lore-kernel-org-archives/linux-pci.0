I noticed there is already an X86 specific check in:

drivers/acpi/resource.c (ie valid_IRQ)

I can add something like code below there and be done with it:

#ifdef CONFIG_X86
static inline bool io_space_valid(struct resource *res)
{
	return res->end < 0x10003;
}
#else
static inline bool io_space_valid(struct resource *res) { return true; }
#endif

if Rafael is ok with that. Whatever I do requires an arch specific hook
(empty/always-true on !CONFIG_X86) to be called from
acpi_dev_ioresource_flags(), otherwise removing that check really becomes
a minefield.

Other solution is reverting back to not using acpi_dev_get_resources()
on IA64 and ARM64 which defeats the whole purpose of Jiang's consolidation,
so I won't go there.

Next step is removing (or refactoring) acpi_pci_root_validate_resources()
for IORESOURCE_IO from acpi_pci_probe_root_resources(), it is a bogus check
as our discussion above highlighted and does not work on ARM64 (it
probably does on IA64 since IO_SPACE_LIMIT == 0xffffffffffffffffUL, but
that's conceptually wrong regardless).


Thanks,
Lorenzo
