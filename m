You are now exporting things from the kernel that were not being
exported in the past.  When you do that, you are now guaranteeing that
this api will be present for forever in the future.

Also libudev, which takes them from the "master" copy that libpci pulls
from.

This makes no sense at all.  If you have legal questions, ask a lawyer,
not a programmer.  Would you ask me medical questions as well?

The kernel is self-contained, and has to be, don't be foolish.

Then you haven't tracked what has happened over time.  They do change,
they are sometimes incorrect, they are extended, and stuff is modified.

This has nothing to do with "pushing vendors" to do anything.

Again, if you have a userspace program that needs these headers, then
use one of the _two_ different packages that userspace already provides
that has them, don't make the kernel become the third provider of the
same header information, that's major duplication of effort for no
reason at all.
