I think I get what you are saying, but let me check.

If a bridge gets reconfigured, it needs to be able to tell if this resource is EA or not.
If it is a fixed EA resource, it doesn't need to include it in its MMIO range.
If it is fixed for some other reason,
	we should make sure the bridges MMIO range includes the fixed region.

You are suggesting that we should add a flag for EA, so if a bridge tries to move,
the bridge knows weather or not the resource is EA,
and therefore if it needs to worry about the resource when setting it's range?

Is that what you are trying to say?
