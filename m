The alignment should only be important if a new address is being 
calculated for a BAR or behind the bridge memory/io region.  If the 
resource is fixed, I would almost say that "alignment" is an undefined 
concept.  So, in the places were we need special treatment for 
IORESOURCE_PCI_FIXED, I would argue that we shouldn't be use the 
resource alignment information.
