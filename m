Just you need to use cryptsetup 1.6.7 version (older versions do not have this options yet).

Anyway, it seems strange that one patch triggers such a problem (leading to a conclusion
that the patch is wrong) but dm-crypt is know to reveal many problems in other systems
exactly this way...

The patches were tested on so many systems without problem that I really believe
the dmcrypt patch is just trigger for a bug elsewhere.

Anyway, if we can find configuration which fails here, I would like to help to find
the core problem... Papering here just means it will break data later elsewhere.

Thanks for testing it!
Milan
