In which case you don't need Tandem. Tandem basically just brings up
minmal bitstream to bring up PCIe link and does the rest via some sort
of partial reconfiguration flow. This allows to meet the PCIe deadline.

Any reason you can't drop a SPI controller in the fabric and use that
to program the FPGA or do you intend to do the initial programing of
the PROM also over PCIe?
